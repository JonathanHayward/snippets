"You pull your arms to your side and glide through the water. On your left is a fountain of bubbles, upside down, beneath a waterfall; the bubbles shoot down and then cascade out and to the surface. To your right swims a school of colorful fish, red and blue with thin black stripes. The water is cool, and you can feel the currents gently pushing and pulling on your body. Ahead of you, seaweed above and long, bright green leaves below wave back and forth, flowing and bending. You pull your arms, again, with a powerful stroke which shoots you forward under the seaweed; your back feels cool in the shade. You kick, and you feel the warmth of the sun again, soaking in and through your skin and muscles. Bands of light dance on the sand beneath you, as the light is bent and turned by the waves.

"Anybody here from the English department? The English department is a special place. If you want to find a Marxist, don't go to the political science department. Nary a Marxist will you find there. Go to the English department. If you want to find a Freudian, don't go to the psychology department. Nary a Freudian will you find there. Go to the English department. If you want to find a Darwinist, don't go to the biology department. Nary a Darwinist will you find there. Go to the English department. The English department is a living graveyard of all the dead and discredited ideologies that have been cast off by other departments.

"I sunk back slightly, and hoped the question would go away. When too she remained silent, I said, \"Elnathan, Manyu, and Antol are all spoken around my village, and I can use them well. I am less fluent in the Icasia tongue, notwithstanding the fact that they trade with our village often. I have a reading knowledge of Grattan and Caspard, and I was once involved in translating something from Liwanu to Sava. That doesn't really count, though--the treatise was highly technical, and as such far easier than talking with a live human. Oh, and I've created a couple of special-purpose languages--one of them written and nonlinear, to more directly reflect what of thought is compressed when it is spoken. People seem to like it, but beyond that I haven't achieved anything significant.\" I sunk back, and said, \"I'm sorry. I'm not very good with languages.\"

"When it comes to games, never try to understand the Janra mind.\" 

-Oeildubeau, Urvanovestilli philosopher and anthropologist 

It is known that Janra sports usually last for at least half an hour, involve a ball, two or more teams, running and acrobatics, and animated discussion. Beyond that, neither the Urvanovestilli's logic nor the Yedidia's intuition are able to make head or tail of them. In general, the teams appear to have unequal numbers of players; the players often switch teams in the course of play; teams are created and dissolved; the nature of the activities makes sudden and radical changes; there is no visible winning or losing. There are occasionally times in the course of play when some intelligible goal appears to be being approached... but then, all players seem to be approaching it in a rather erratic manner (when asked why he didn't do thus and such simple thing and achieve the approached goal by an inexperienced anthropologist, one of the Janra said, \"Technically, that would work, but that would be a very boring way to do it,\" and then bolted back into play: the extent to which game play is comprehensible heightens its incomprehensibility). Late in life, Oeildubeau hinted at having suspicions that, if the Janra believe that they are being watched, they will spontaneously stop whatever sport they are playing, and instead begin a series of activities expressly designed to give any observer a headache.

"I saw it, and then wondered how I had not seen it--an alabaster palace rising out of the dark rock around it, hidden in a niche as foothill became mountain. After I saw it, I realized--I could not tell if the plants around me were wild or garden, but there was a grassy spot around it. Some of my fatigue eased as I looked into a pond and saw koi and goldfish swimming.

I looked around and saw the Gothic buildings, the trees, the stone path and walkways. I was beginning to relax, when I heard a voice say, \"Good evening,\" and looked, and realized there was a man on the bench in front of me.
