# following syntaxes:
#
# name value
# name "value"
# 
# If a comment contains a space, it may be quoted as follows:
#

#
# Quotation marks inside the value may be quoted by backslashes:
#
# name "one \"two three\""
# 

#
# Configuration file data:

#
# The URL of the program.  Both an absolute URL such as
# "http://yourhost.com/cgi-bin/snippets" and a relative URL like
# "/cgi-bin/snippets" will work; the relative URL will load more quickly and is
# therefore suggested.

# default.  This may be "guest", "login", or "wiki", and must be a permitted

#
# What method, by default, to display.  This may be:
#	html: treats snippets as HTML and allows them to pass through unmodified.
#	text: converts snippets to display essentially as text.  This option
#		disables all HTML features I'm aware of (links, images, etc.)
#	mixed: displays as HTML, but formats reasonably.  Under html, everything in
#		a snippet will appear as one big paragraph, even if separated by a
#		blank line.  In mixed mode, blank lines separate.
#	The default is "mixed".
