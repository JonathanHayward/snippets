<h1>Snippets privacy policy</h1>

<p>If you are seeing this message, Snippets has been set up, but the privacy
policy has been set up.  Please
<a href="mailto:SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL">contact the administrator</a> and request a
privacy policy to be set up.</p>

<p>Entering something into Snippets is like putting something in a box, marking
it as "private", and putting a lightweight lock onto it.  Honorable people will
leave it alone, and casual snoopers won't get in, but anyone who comes with a
crowbar will be able to open it.  Snippets is designed to afford basic
protection, but not to repel serious attack; you should therefore <em>not</em>
use it to store credit card information or other sensitive material.</p>

<p>What should you use it for?  Well, here are a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jokes</li>
<li>Quotes</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Websites to visit</li>
<li>Friends to write/e-mail/call</li>
<li>A to-do list of things you'd like to work on.</li>
<li>Places to visit</li>
<li>Books to read</li>
<li>Favorite pictures</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
